OF is any outfield position. UTIL is any batter, doesn't matter the position (kind of like a DH)."

    "No worries, in order to help even out the playing field a bit, here are some hints that can help you in the draft.  \n",
    "1. Try to get other people to spend their money on players that you don't want but you think that other people will. You can use ESPN draft rankings you help find discrepencies between your rankings and the ones that other people will see to help with that.  \n",
    "2. There's more than one strategy to building a team. You can blow all your money on some top tier talent and fill in the rest of your team with cheap players, or build a more balanced roster. Both can work.  \n",
    "3. There's position scarcity in baseball (some positions are deeper than others), meaning that the worst 2B on a roster might put up 1.9 points a game while the worst 1B on a roster might put up 2.5. Establishing a replacement level *wink wink* for each position can help you guage which players are more valuable just becuase of the position they play. \n",
    "4. Fantasy value does not always equal real life value. We don't care about defense and players have to play to score points. There might be some great guy sitting on an MLB teams bench, but he's not going to give you fantasy points if he's only playing every third day. Here, counting stats matter.  \n",
    "5. The league is only going to last a little over a month (the last day of points scoring will be 11:59pm on April 28th), meaning that prospects or players that won't be called up until midway through the season (Vlad Jr., Eloy) aren't realy worth drafting. You're welcome to ask if you don't know who those players are."

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the way points are to be assigned in this fantasy league, we opted for a relatively simple way of valuing players. We opted to choose a few statistics for pitchers and batters, calculate where each player falls in percentile for those statistics, then weight those percentiles and sum them to get a \"score\" for the player. We then scale that score to get a dollar cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data and Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "Data was gathered for the years 2016, 2017, and 2018. Statcast data was used for pitching and FanGraphs data for batting.\n",
    "\n",
    "For batters we chose OPS, BA, and caught stealing per hit. These columns were then converted to their percentile values. Score is calculated as 2xOPS percentile + 1.6xBA percentile - 0.3xsteals per hit percentile. These weights were roughly decided based on how points are assigned in the fantasy scheme. This score was then scaled by a factor of 11 to get a dollar value.\n",
    "\n",
    "For pitchers we chose IP per game, HR per batter, strike percentage, and HBP and walks per batter. We chose weights of 3, -1, 1.8, and -0.4 respectively. This score was then scaled by 9 to get a dollar value.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results\n",

    "## Limitations\n",

    "Our way of converting score to monetary value does not take into account the max of \\$250 compared with the number of players that can be drafted. This means our conversion is a very rough estimate in this regard and so our monetary values cannot necessarily be trusted to be exact. Our method of scoring players is also imperfect as we are just applying rough weights to percentiles based on what appear to be important statistics according to the league scoring method."
