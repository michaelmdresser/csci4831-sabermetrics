    "# Introduction to pyBaseball\n",
    "For the first part of this class, we'll use the pyBaseball package to access data. pyBaseball is a python package that provides a nice API for the Baseball Savant website and the Lahman database. Lahman is actually a bunch of .csv files that you download onto your local machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are lots of examples of pyBaseball queries on their github repo. I encourage you to rummage through the site and look at what's available. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you haven't already done so, you need to install pyBaseball.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open a terminal and type the following commands to pull the latest pybaseball\n",
    "\n",
    "* git clone https://github.com/jldbc/pybaseball\n",
    "* cd pybaseball\n",
